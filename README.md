# PNPSKC
### a Greedy algorithm for solving the Positive Negative Partial Set K-Cover problem

## Getting Started

The Greedy_PNPSKC algorithm can be used to do feature selection in a sense that multiple features are expected to co-occur in the positive samples rather than in the negative samples.

```
Git clone https://github.com/unfashionable/PNPSKC.git

python Greedy_PNPSKC.py HRGP_dataset/HRGP_raw_both_strand.csv 3
```

You should be able to see a result file `Greedy.3.result`.


### Prerequisites
The following python libs are required:

`Pandas`

`sklearn`

`numpy`
